    Problems: Which features are to be used? Where are the boundaries?
    
    Definition of a pattern or feature vector: \\
    $\bm x = [x_1, \ldots, x_n]^T$
    Classes: $\bm x \rightarrow K_1, \ldots, K_W$

      \skriptsubsubsection{Minimum Distance Classification}{866}
        Sample will be assigned to the class to which the mean is the shortest.

        When the \em Mahalanobis distance \em is taken instead of the Euclidean distance, the variance is 
        also included in the min-dist-classifier:
        $$\boxed{D_j(\bm{x})^2 = (\bm x - \bm m_j)^T \bm{C}_j^{-1} (\bm x -\bm m_j)}$$
        with $\bm C_j$ as the covariance matrix for every 
        sample per class: 
        $$\bm C_j = \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{\bm x \in K_j} \bm x \bm x^T - \bm m_j \bm m_j^T.$$
        
      \skriptsubsubsection{Matching by Correlation}{869}
        Correlation is not robust in terms of background and freeform objects (only square objects).
        
      \skriptsubsubsection{Bayes Classifier}{874}
        Binary loss function: $d_j(\bm x) = p(\bm x | K_j) p(K_j)$ ($j=1,\ldots,W$).
        $p(\bm x | K_j)$ is assumed to be Gaussian distributed:      
        $$d_j(\bm x) = \ln p(K_j)  - \frac{1}{2} \ln |\bm C_j| - \frac12 (\bm x - m_j)^T \bm C_j^{-1} (\bm x - m_j)) $$
